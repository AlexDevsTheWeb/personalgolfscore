# PGS - Personal Golf Score

This project is about a Personal golf score, where the user can register, log in and record all their golf games, mark the outcomes of the shots on the course, the distances, the penalties, the putts and the saves from the sand.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
